This repository contains two seperate CorDapps for the the two day Corda Training Course.
Each CorDapp can be found in the `training` & `hello-corda` folders in the root of this repo.
HelloCorda! is a short introduction to CorDapp development while the Corda Training Template goes into more depth.
More information on each section can be found in the README of each respective lesson.
